# csv2little_r

DESCRIPTION:
This procedure is designed to convert csv data file format into LITTLE_R
that WRFDA will ingest.
From WRFDA Tutorial:
'LITTLE_R is an ASCII-based observation file format, in use since the MM5 era. 
Because raw observation data files have many possible formats (such as ASCII, 
BUFR, PREPBUFR, MADIS, and HDF) LITTLE_R is designed to be an intermediate 
format so that WRFDA might be able to assimilate as many observation types as 
possible in a universal manner. It is a report-based file format, so all 
manner of observation types can easily be "cat-ted" together into an 
easy-to-read and -edit text file.'
Input file is supposed to be like this:
Chieti;14.181;42.377;20111025_0630;139
Teramo;13.711;42.656;20111025_0530;207
L_Aquila;13.432;42.339;20111025_0530;180
i.e.
NAME;LON;LAT;YYYYMMDD_hhmm;VARIABLE_VALUE
where variable can be one of the following:
WIND SPEED (SPD)
WIND DIRECTION (DIR)
TEMPERATURE (TMP)
PRESSURE (BAR)
RELATIVE HUMIDITY (IGR)
ZONAL WIND (UWND)
MERIDIONAL WIND (VWND)
THICKNESS (THICK)
where
pressure is in Pa
temperature is in K
wind speed is in m/s
wind direction is in degrees
relative humidity is in %
zonal and meridional wind are in m/s (actually they were not tested)
thickness is in m (actually it was not tested)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
* Linux system
* /bin/bash
* a Fortran compiler (gfortran worked for me..no other compilers were tested..)

INSTALL:
* tar/unzip the source code
* cd csv2little_r
* you have the following dir/files:
  - configure: - checks for system features and copies files and directories to the working directoy
  - env: contains configuration parameters for the procedure
  - src: contains a Bash procedure and the fortran
* run ./configure /path/to/where/you/want/working/directory

RUN:
* cd env
* edit the 'test.env' file according to your needs (if any). The file has minimal comments, if your are in doubts write me at valcap74@gmail.com
* cd ../srs
* sh csv2little_r.sh INPUTFILE_with_PATH SPD|DIR|TMP|BAR|IGR|UWND|VWND|THICK
  example:
  sh csv2little_r.sh ../data/sample.file.wind WND
  
TODO:
this is a very first attempt so a lot of stuff to improve the procedure is needed.
Nevertheless the procedure works in most cases.
